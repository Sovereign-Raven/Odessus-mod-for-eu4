 timariot_system_desc: "The Ottoman Sultanate developed a system of feudal land holding to build up and maintain a cavalry force. Each Timariot was responsible for supplying cavalry for the imperial army based upon the amount of land he held."
 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC: "The latest crusade has been victorious for the Christian League; the Ottomans, left terribly shaken and weakened, now had to leave the continent altogether. Christianity has been united in this long and holy battle once again after so many centuries, and the fruits of victory are showing: Poland and the dynasty ruling it, the House of Jagiellon, has become one, if not the strongest and most influential family in all of Europe, their influence now reaching towards the west and east as well. The Balkan peninsula has been liberated, and the Orthodox people can serve God once again, but it's inevitable that the Eastern Roman Empire and other nations with long-reaching past and glory will rise to power on behalf of the others' fall. Amongst all of this, the Council of Florence shall continue and Christianity may unite once again, while contemplating the continuation of the crusades."
