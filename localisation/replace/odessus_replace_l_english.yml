 timariot_system_desc: "The Ottoman Sultanate developed a system of feudal land holding to build up and maintain a cavalry force. Each Timariot was responsible for supplying cavalry for the imperial army based upon the amount of land he held."
 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC: "The latest crusade has been victorious for the Christian League; the Ottomans, left terribly shaken and weakened, now had to leave the continent altogether. Christianity has been united in this long and holy battle once again after so many centuries, and the fruits of victory are showing: Poland and the dynasty ruling it, the House of Jagiellon, has become one, if not the strongest and most influential family in all of Europe, their influence now reaching towards the west and east as well. The Balkan peninsula has been liberated, and the Orthodox people can serve God once again, but it's inevitable that the Eastern Roman Empire and other nations with long-reaching past and glory will rise to power on behalf of the others' fall. Amongst all of this, the Council of Florence shall continue and Christianity may unite once again, while contemplating the continuation of the crusades."

 BYZ_greece_title: "The Phoenix Rises Again!"
 BYZ_greece_desc: "The Roman Empire has been constantly declining for about a millenium now. With small periods of recovery from time to time, today we may be lying at the definitive end of our journey. With the Ottomans encroached, a new beginning for Rome has come. While the Ottomans are still weakened, let us strike and bolster our position in the Balkans."

 land_of_ambushers_desc: "Such is the geography of Albania, filled with fertile lowlands and hills, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocky terrain. For centuries the Albanian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. However Skanderbeg changed it all; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. The enemy will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their capital with their tails tucked between their legs."

 greek_strengthen_control_over_the_trade_routes_desc: "From Rome to Venice and later the Ottoman Sultanate many have sought to control the trade between East and West by conquering Greece and the Greek islands of the Eastern Mediterranean. As an independent Greek state it is our duty and our heritage to control this trade for ourselves rather than allow others to grow rich from our strategic position."

 albanian_tolerance_desc: "Due to Turbulence in the region, the lands and peoples of Albania have found themselves ruled by many different overlords. Because of these many overlords, the Albanians have grown to become very accepting and tolerant of Foreigners. Albania is one of very few places where followers of Christianity, both Orthodox and Catholic manage to live side by side in complete peace."

 pol_jagiellonian_university_desc: "Established in 1364, Krakow's Jagiellonian University is perhaps one of the greatest places in all of Europe! It has brought in, taught, and cultivated a variety of philosophical and scientific minds the likes of which Europe could almost never live without, let alone the Polish and Hungarian people. Going forth, Jagiellonian University will continue to be one of the brightest points in our grand Commonwealth."

 plc_the_obrona_potoczna_desc: "What we term a 'continuous defense' is really a standing army that is paid for by the monarch from their own pocket. They are stationed traditionally in troubled areas or places where the border with a neighbor is not clearly defined so that Commonwealth interests are not intruded upon. Over time, this military sector of ours is going to yield for us highly trained soldiers and skilled generals who know just how to deal with enemies of all types, whether they're of Polish, Hungarian, Croatian, or foreign descent."

 plc_tempered_by_neighbors_desc: "All around us there is conflict. Swedish people? Baltic conflicts. Lithuanians? Succession disputes. Teutons? Old grudges and lusts for land. Russians? Ambition for land on both sides. Time and time again we have been tested in combat since our borders in the east and west are hard to define beyond a hand-drawn map, but these times of war did not break down the Polish and Hungarian people, it only made them stronger."
