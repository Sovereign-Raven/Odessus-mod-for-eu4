 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC: "The latest crusade has been victorious for the Christian League; the Ottomans, left terribly shaken and weakened, now had to leave the continent altogether. Christianity has been united in this long and holy battle once again after so many centuries, and the fruits of victory are showing: Poland and the dynasty ruling it, the House of Jagiellon, has become one, if not the strongest and most influential family in all of Europe, their influence now reaching towards the west and east as well. The Balkan peninsula has been liberated, and the Orthodox people can serve God once again, but it's inevitable that the Eastern Roman Empire and other nations with long-reaching past and glory will rise to power on behalf of the others' fall. Amongst all of this, the Council of Florence shall continue and Christianity may unite once again, while contemplating the continuation of the crusades."

 BYZ_greece_desc: "The Roman Empire has been constantly declining for about a millenium now.

For centuries the Albanian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. However Skanderbeg changed it all; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. The enemy will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their capital with their tails tucked between their legs."

 greek_strengthen_control_over_the_trade_routes_desc: "From Rome to Venice and later the Ottoman Sultanate many have sought to control the trade between East and West by conquering Greece and the Greek islands of the Eastern Mediterranean.

 albanian_tolerance_desc: "Due to Turbulence in the region, the lands and peoples of Albania have found themselves ruled by many different overlords.

Going forth, Jagiellonian University will continue to be one of the brightest points in our grand Commonwealth."

 plc_the_obrona_potoczna_desc: "What we term a 'continuous defense' is really a standing army that is paid for by the monarch from their own pocket. They are stationed traditionally in troubled areas or places where the border with a neighbor is not clearly defined so that Commonwealth interests are not intruded upon.

 plc_tempered_by_neighbors_desc: "All around us there is conflict. Swedish people? Baltic conflicts. Lithuanians? Succession disputes. Teutons? Old grudges and lusts for land. Russians?

However, during wars these experienced, tough men often filled the ranks of Serbian armies, providing excellent - if a bit undisciplined - infantry."

Some of the most notable are the castles scattered in the Carpathians, residence of royalty and nobles of Hungary, and Malbork, captured from the Teutonic Order. Further improvements to them would make them charming and safe temporary residences for our court."
