Christianity has been united in this long and holy battle once again after so many centuries, and the fruits of victory are showing: Poland and the dynasty ruling it, the House of Jagiellon, has become one, if not the strongest and most influential family in all of Europe, their influence now reaching towards the west and east as well. The Balkan peninsula has been liberated, and the Orthodox people can serve God once again, but it's inevitable that the Eastern Roman Empire and other nations with long-reaching past and glory will rise to power on behalf of the others' fall. Amongst all of this, the Council of Florence shall continue and Christianity may unite once again, while contemplating the continuation of the crusades."

We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. The enemy will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their capital with their tails tucked between their legs."

These men lived the hard life of brigands, always in danger, always on the move: preying on poorly defended roads, ambushing foreign tax collectors and merchants. However, during wars these experienced, tough men often filled the ranks of Serbian armies, providing excellent - if a bit undisciplined - infantry."
