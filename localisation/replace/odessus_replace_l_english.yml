 timariot_system_desc: "The Ottoman Sultanate developed a system of feudal land holding to build up and maintain a cavalry force. Each Timariot was responsible for supplying cavalry for the imperial army based upon the amount of land he held."
 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC: "Europe in 1445 is on the verge of the Age of Discovery whilst also celebrating the victory over the heathens, ready to finish the works of the council and mend the Great Schism. Meanwhile, the Ottomans are trying to recover from their great losses and assert their position in the Middle East before another contender tries to take their place and become the next Caliphate. It seems like Eastern Europe and its surroundings will become just as relevant and influental on a global scale as the middle of the continent, or even the soon-to-be superpowers of the West."
