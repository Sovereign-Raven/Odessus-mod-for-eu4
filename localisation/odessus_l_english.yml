We finally managed what we couldn't do in previous centuries, nor could any other nation do: Constantinople is now in our hands!\n\nAfter the city has been extinguished of the Greek and other people that no longer feel safe, the Catholic realm is now interested more than ever. They definitely enjoy that a more powerful and suitable Emperor is now in control, who is also on better terms with the western world, compared to the old ways of the Byzantine ruler. This is a great opportunity for the city to turn into a large center of trade and an increasingly important point of destination of people and goods of the world.\n\nWith this in mind, perhaps it's a good idea to settle down here, and set the city as the seat of our Tsar. Under a new name, of course..."

Along those lines, the Kingdom of Bulgaria was declared independent. After a long discussion, it was decided that instead of a Jagiellon relative, Fruzhin Shishman, a skilled general from the well-known Stratsimir dynasty shall rule over the Bulgarian Kingdom.\n\nWith him in line, the fate of Bulgaria is now up to Fruzhin and his successors to rise Bulgaria up onto the podium of the Great Powers."
